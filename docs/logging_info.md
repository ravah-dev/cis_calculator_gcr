## **Default Behavior**

By default, Python's `logging` library sends log messages to the standard output (`stdout`), which means:

1. **When Running Locally**:
   - Logs will appear in your terminal or command-line interface (where you run the application).

2. **When Running in a Docker Container**:
   - Logs are written to the container's `stdout`, which can be viewed using Docker commands like:

     ```bash
     docker logs <container_id>
     ```

   - Replace `<container_id>` with your container's ID or name.

### **Customizing the Logger Output**

If you want to redirect log messages to a file or another destination, you can configure a file handler in your logger setup. Hereâ€™s how:

#### Example: Add a File Handler

```python
import logging

# Logger setup
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(),  # Sends logs to stdout (default)
        logging.FileHandler("app.log")  # Sends logs to a file named 'app.log'
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### **Accessing Logs in Google Cloud Run**

When your container runs in **Google Cloud Run**, the logs are sent to **Cloud Logging** (formerly Stackdriver) by default. You can access them via the GCP Console:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Logging** â†’ **Logs Explorer**.
3. Filter logs by your service name or specific log messages.

---

### **Key Notes**

- **Log Levels**:
  - Use levels like `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, etc., to categorize logs.
  - These levels can help you filter logs in Cloud Logging or other monitoring tools.

- **Log Rotation**:
  - If writing to a file, consider setting up log rotation to avoid large log files. Use Python's `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` for this purpose.

---

### Testing Logger Output

1. Run the application locally and verify that logs appear in the terminal.
2. If using a file handler, check the `app.log` file for log entries.
3. Deploy to your Docker container and use `docker logs` to inspect the logs.
4. In Cloud Run, validate that logs are reaching Cloud Logging.
